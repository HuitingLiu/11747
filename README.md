1. reproducing the results of a state-of-the-art baseline model for the task of interest with code that you have implemented from scratch
2. In your report, also perform an analysis of what remaining errors this model makes (ideally with concrete examples of failure cases), and describe how you plan to create a new model for the final project that will address these error cases.
